The Landing Page Assignment in The Odin Project has been completed. 
This assignment took me longer than expected. 
I'm not very pleased with what I've done so far due to lots of repitition in code.
It also breaks when I resize the size of window. 
Maybe I'll refine the code in the future. 
For now, I'll move on to the Javascript section in TOP.
